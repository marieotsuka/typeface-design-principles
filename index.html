			<h2>Syllabus</h2>
			<p>
				Understanding the foundations of type design can be helpful for any designer working with letterforms, whether as a user of type or someone who has to create or alter letterforms. Through this ten-week introduction, we will take a closer look at typefaces, explore how they work, and learn how to draw our own.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will begin by getting a feel for the basic components of type — black and white shapes — through hands-on sketching, then transition into using the Glyphs font editor to draw vector outlines. By the end of the course, you will have an understanding of the principles of typeface design, with a draft of your first typeface.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ten-week program will consist of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Lectures: introductions to key concepts and strategies for design</li>
				<li>Activities: in-class exploratory exercises and general work time</li>
				<li>Critique: a combination of group critiques and one-on-one reviews of your work</li>
				<li>Assignments: take-home assignments ensure you are reaching milestones in the design process</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The course is open to beginners with vector-based tools such as Adobe Illustrator, graphic designers, as well as those interested in developing a type portfolio for application to further type design studies. We recommend you allocate at least an additional 3 hours of project time per week to gain the most from your experience.
